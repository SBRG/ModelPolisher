# ModelPolisher
ModelPolisher accesses the BiGG Models knowledgebase to annotate and autocomplete SBML models.
Thereby, the program mainly relies on BiGG identifiers for model components.
In addition, it fixes some obvious errors in the models.

An online version of this program is available at https://webservices.cs.uni-tuebingen.de.
