# ModelPolisher
ModelPolisher accesses the [BiGG Models knowledgebase](http://bigg.ucsd.edu) to annotate and autocomplete SBML models.
Thereby, the program mainly relies on [BiGG identifiers](https://github.com/SBRG/bigg_models/wiki/BiGG-Models-ID-Specification-and-Guidelines) for model components.
In addition, it fixes some obvious errors in the models.

An online version of this program is available at https://webservices.cs.uni-tuebingen.de.
